# CS2_HonorsProject

The PCC CS002 Honors students, for their honors project, have created an interface where 1. users can ask questions and receive a proper answer about the computer science department by 3d graphics (named Rachel and Brad), and 2. anyone with access can modify the database to modify the questions and answers. 

**Components:**
1. The USC VHToolkit - https://vhtoolkit.ict.usc.edu/<br> 
2. Database with questions and answers - plist file<br> 
3. The questions and answers file - answers_and_questions_txt<br>
